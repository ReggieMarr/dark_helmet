** TODO projectile don't follow symlinks
** TODO switch to skim for all fuzzy searches

* Workflow tasks
** TODO Org captures
*** Motivation
Org captures are powerful because it reduces friction when researching concepts, documenting code, and understanding technical documents.
The idea is to promote this such that we can easily capture links to code, documents and webpages.
*** Ideas/subtasks
+ We want two primary types of captures ::
  + Simple Links to a specific component of a source medium (i.e. a link to a pdf page or specific text)
  + Image Links to a component of a source medium (i.e. a pdf page show as an image)
In both cases the capture should be clickable and link back to the source material.
The following mediums should be capturable in this way.
**** TODO PDF's
**** TODO Code
**** TODO Webpages (static media)
**** TODO Webpages (videos)
- [-] Code

** TODO Jira integration
** TODO Email Integration
** TODO MDE Integration
* Things to lookinto
** TODO emacs macros
